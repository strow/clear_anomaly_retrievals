* Overview

- Git repo for the code that actually runs the anomaly retrievals
- Each commit should include a message (which can be long) as to what run is being committed.

** Commit Messages

- Top line is what you see with git log, keep it one line, max 50 characters
- Then SKIP A LINE
- Then put in a longer message that explains all that is going on with this commit/run
- Best to wrap the longer message to max 72 characters

** What to Avoid

- Storage of any results (.gitignore takes care of that)
- No analysis here (use another repo that you control)
